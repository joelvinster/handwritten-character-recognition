# Handwritten Character Recognition System

This project is a **Handwritten Character Recognition System** built using **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning** techniques. The system is designed to recognize handwritten characters and can be extended to recognize entire words or sentences.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for character recognition.
- **Dataset Handling**: Supports preprocessing and augmentation for improved accuracy.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Implements model training, validation, and performance assessment.
- **Google Colab Support**: Can be trained and tested in Google Colab.
- **Extensibility**: Can be extended to recognize full words and sentences.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy & Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Google Colab**

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-character-recognition.git
   cd handwritten-character-recognition
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   OR (if using Google Colab, upload the `.ipynb` file and run the cells).

## Usage
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is available in the correct format.
2. **Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed, resized, and normalized.
3. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model on the dataset.
4. **Testing & Evaluation**: Test the trained model on new handwritten characters.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict handwritten inputs.

## Example Output
The model will classify handwritten characters and provide accuracy metrics. Sample output:
```
Predicted: 'A', Confidence: 98%
Predicted: 'B', Confidence: 96%
```

## Future Improvements
- Extend to full handwritten word recognition
- Improve accuracy with larger datasets
- Deploy as a web application using Flask/Django
